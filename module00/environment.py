'''
math.sin(math.pi * hour / 24): The sine function takes an angle (in radians). By multiplying hour / 24 by Ï€ (pi), you ensure the temperature follows a full cycle from 0 to 23 hours. The sine wave goes from -1 to 1 over 24 hours, which will give us values oscillating around the midpoint (mid_temp).
Morning: Around hour 6, the sine wave starts rising.
Noon: Around hour 12, the sine wave reaches the peak (+1).
Evening: Around hour 18, it starts decreasing.
Midnight: Around hour 24, it goes back to its lowest point (-1).
