1. The Goal of the Program:
    The goal is to optimize the frequency settings for antennas placed around Forty2 (the fort), 
so that the 4G/5G signal quality at key locations (dorms, kitchen, showers, cluster, and entrance)
is as strong as possible.
    The program uses Genetic Algorithms (GA), which are inspired by natural selection, to iteratively 
improve a population of frequency settings to reach the optimal antenna configuration.
2. Overall Flow of the Genetic Algorithm:
P   opulation Initialization: We start with a population of random individuals, each representing a 
set of 4 antenna frequencies. These frequencies are between 45.0 MHz and 50.0 MHz.
    Evaluation: The fitness of each individual (i.e., a set of frequencies) is evaluated based on how 
well it performs in terms of signal reliability at the 5 key locations. The ./cellular program is 
used to evaluate the performance, and it returns reliability scores for each location.
    Selection: The individuals with the highest fitness scores (best antenna frequency configurations)
are selected to form the next generation.
    Crossover: Pairs of individuals (parents) are combined to produce offspring by crossing over 
portions of their frequency settings.
    Mutation: Some offspring undergo mutation, where one of their frequency settings is randomly 
altered.
    Iteration: This process is repeated for multiple generations, each time improving the population 
towards the optimal frequency configuration.

Why the Code Works:
    Genetic Algorithm Principles: The code implements the core concepts of a genetic algorithm: 
population initialization, fitness evaluation, selection, crossover, and mutation.
    Real-World Connection: The integration with the ./cellular program allows the algorithm to 
assess antenna frequency performance in real-world conditions, making the optimization process 
grounded in actual data.
    Iterative Improvement: Through multiple generations, the algorithm evolves better solutions, 
moving closer to the optimal antenna configuration that maximizes signal quality at the five 
locations.
